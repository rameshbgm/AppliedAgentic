### 🎨 Design Vision: 
The aesthetic should feel weightless and futuristic, yet warm and inviting for long reading sessions.

* **3D/WebGL:** Use **React Three Fiber** to create a subtle, interactive background layer (e.g., floating geometric particles or a slow-waving nebula) that reacts to cursor movement but does not distract.
* **Glassmorphism:** Content must sit on high-quality "frosted glass" panels  to ensure perfect contrast against the neon background.

* **Motion:** Implement **Lenis** for luxury smooth scrolling and **Framer Motion** for elements that drift/fade into view.

### 📖 The Typography Strategy (Critical)
* **Headline Font:** *Space Grotesk* or *Syne* — bold, futuristic, wide tracking for impact.
* **Reading Font:** *Geist Sans*, *Satoshi*, or *Inter* — a friendly, humanist sans-serif with tall x-heights.

* **Approach:** Mobile-first, fully responsive.

3.  **The Background Component:** A performant R3F component rendering the floating particles or mesh.
